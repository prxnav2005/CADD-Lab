# CADD-Lab

This repository contains 45 System-Verilog codes(questions) for both combinational and sequential circuits. Each question has its own seperate folder with both the Design and Testbench codes so as to ease the access of the desired question. 

## Sequential-Circuits

When it comes to the Sequential-Circuits folder, the Latches and Flip-Flops folder have sub folders for the different Latches and Flip-Flops. Along with this, the FSMs folder also got its own sub folders to seperate the Moore and Mealy model.
