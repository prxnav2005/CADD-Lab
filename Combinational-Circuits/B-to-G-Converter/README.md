The Binary to Gray Code Converter is used to convert binary number to gray code value. Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

1. The MSB of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary number.
2. Each subsequent bit of the Gray code is generated by XOR-ing the corresponding bit of the binary number with the bit to its left.
